# ChicagoCrimes:
> This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago. Data is extracted from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. In order to protect the privacy of crime victims, addresses are shown at the block level only and specific locations are not identified. *You can find the original dataset [here](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2).*

# Data Wrangling:
Data is mostly clean, but after assessing it visually and programmatically the following quality issues were found and cleaned:
* erroneous data type of (ID, Date, Crime_Description, Location_Description, District) columns.
* missing data in some columns.

# Objective:
> Data visualisation project using Microsoft Power BI.
